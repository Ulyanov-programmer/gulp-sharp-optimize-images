# gulp-sharp-optimize-images

> Compression and conversion of images for gulp using [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp).

## What is this

### With this thing you can: <br>

- Optimize your images.
- Convert your images to other formats (including, but not limited to `.webp` and `.avif`).

### Features

- Using the [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) plugin.
- Has a minimum of dependencies.
- Supported formats: `.png .jpg/jpeg .webp .avif .tiff .heif .gif`

## Why is this

- [imagemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin) is unmaintained, [see the issue](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin/issues/385).
- [gulp-libsquoosh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-libsquoosh) uses the outdated library [@squoosh/lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@squoosh/lib), which does not have support for node > 16.0.0. In addition, the squoosh lib is no longer maintained.
- [@donmahallem/gulp-sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@donmahallem/gulp-sharp) does not have normal documentation.

## API

```js
sharpOptimizeImages({
  outputImageExtname: {
    param: value,
  },
  imageExtname_to_imageExtname: {
    param: value,
  },
});
```

### outputImageExtname

Type: `object`<br>
An object that allows you to convert `all` images into images of a `specific type`.
<br>

avif: {

},
```

### imageExtname_to_imageExtname

Type: `object`<br>
An object that allows you to convert images of a `specific type` into images of a `specific type`. <br>

```js
// example, all images in the format .jpg will be converted to .heif
jpg_to_heif: {
  param: value,
},
// you can also optimize images without changing the extension
jpg_to_jpg: {
  param: value,
},
